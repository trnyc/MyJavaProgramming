Topic: Map Continue
	   Functional Interface & Lambda intro

package name: day52_Map_FunctionalInterface

 *** The purpose of regular interface is to provide additional methods to the classes
    Regular interface can have as many abstract methot as needed. You need to OVERRIDE absract method
    of regular interfece in the sublclasses.

 *** The purpose of functional interface is to create function, not for inheritance and functional
 interface CAN ONLY HAVE ONE ABSTRACT METHOD. You need use LAMBDA EXPRESSION to be able to create FUNCTION
   for the method of functional interface. Both regular and functional interface can have abstracat metod.
 And abstract method does not have BODY.

Warmup tasks:
	1. Write a program that can find the unique characters from a String

			Ex:
					str = "aabcccdeeeef";

			output:
					{b=1, d=1, f=1}

	2. Go to Package day52_Map_FunctionalInterface -> ListOfMapPractice1, and Complete all the given task requirments




List of Map

Array of Map

Map of Map




Unit Assessment 5&6:
	avsilable from: Martch 12th
	until: Mratch 13th




Assignments:
	Write a program that can find the character that has the highest frequency in a String
        Note: Must use a map

        Ex:
            str = "eeeeeaaabbbbccccdd"

        Output:
            {e=5, a=3, b=4, c=4, d=2 }
            character e has the highest frequency


	Write a program that can find the element that has the highest frequency in an arrayList
	        Note: Must use a map

	        Ex:
	            list: [java, java, python, c#]

	        output:
	            [java=2, python=1, c#=1]
	            element java has the highest frequency
