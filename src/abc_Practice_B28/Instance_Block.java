    /* The instance block can be defined as the name-less method in java inside which we can define
    logic and they possess certain characteristics as follows. They can be declared inside classes
    but not inside any method. Instance block logic is common for all the objects. Instance block
    will be executed only once for each object during its creation.
      Instance blocks are executed whenever an object of any kind is created. If we want to write
    a logic that we want to execute on the creation of all kinds of objects, then using instance
    blocks is a good idea to avoid writing the same logic inside every constructor.
      We generally donâ€™t use them for the initialization of objects because they can not accept the
    parameters. If we still use instance blocks for the purpose of initialization, then all the objects
    will have to be initialized with the same values which are practically useless.*/
